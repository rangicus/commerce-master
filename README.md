# CommerceMaster

CommerceMaster is a GUI calculator to help you determine the best routes for your commercing in Mabinogi.

## Running

At the moment I haven't compiled any executables or anything. This means that you'll have to install the following pip packages:

- [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)

## Editing

All of the values for *Trading Posts*, *Items*, and *Vehicles* are hardcoded at the moment. So you'll just have to figure it out and write Python if you want different values. I'll be adding JSON config support soonâ„¢.
