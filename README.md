# CommerceMaster

CommerceMaster is a GUI calculator to help you determine the best routes for your commercing in Mabinogi.

## Using

At the moment I haven't compiled any executables or anything.
This means that you'll have to install the following pip packages:

- [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)

## Editing

Available vehicles can be edited in the `config/vehicles.json` file.
It will probably need some editing because it only has the vehicles that I use,
and unless you also have William the Partner Vehicle numbers will be incorrect.

All of the values for *Trading Posts* and *Items* are hardcoded at the moment.
So you'll just have to figure it out and write Python if you want different values.
I'll be adding JSON config support soonâ„¢.
